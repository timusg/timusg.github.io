Over a decade of building and scaling distributed systems.

I am passionate about writing softwares and solving complex buisness
problems by applying my technology knowledge. I believe in automation
and follow Devops and Agile culture.
I am a polyglot with special interest in Go and Ruby based technologies
with hands on in virtualization, networking, cloud computing platforms
and mobile application development.

I enjoy architecting and implementation of large scale distributed
platforms. I have been a part of various organisations from product
startups to the one building for large financial institutions
